    "Let the node at which we are starting be called the '''initial node'''. Let the '''distance of node ''Y''''' be the distance from the '''initial node''' to ''Y''. Dijkstra's algorithm will assign some initial distance values and will try to improve them step by step.\n",

    "1. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbours and calculate their ''tentative'' distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated ''tentative'' distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node ''A'' is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbour ''B'' has length 2, then the distance to ''B'' through ''A'' will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, the current value will be kept.\n",

If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the ''unvisited set'' is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n",
